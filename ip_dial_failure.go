// own file until this line's ip.go is brought forward.

// inferredDialFailureTimeout is the multi client's silence-inference horizon,
// the retransmit at which it re-races a flow on its own (upstream
// ip_remote_multi_client.go). A dial that fails later than this is not signalled.

// dialFailureAction classifies a failed upstream DialContext into the signal
// the provider sends back to the source in place of the SynAck. Without a
// signal the source sits in syn-retransmit backoff (3s..63s) and the blackhole
// timeout eventually removes the provider along with its working flows -- the
// bug this replaces for a dial that fails at once. A dial that times out is
// left to the source's own backoff and the client's silence inference (see
// classifyDialFailure).

// classifyDialFailure maps an upstream DialContext error, and how long the dial
// took to fail, to the signal the provider should return in place of a SynAck.
// It is pure -- no live socket, no ConnectionState, no clock -- so the errno
// logic is unit-testable.
//
// For dialFailureUnreachable the built icmp packet is returned as well (a fresh
// non-pool buffer from ipOosUnreachable; the caller copies it into the pool
// before delivery). For dialFailureRst and dialFailureNone the packet is nil --
// a RST needs the ConnectionState's sequence state, so the caller builds it.
//
// A dial that timed out gets nothing (isDialTimeout), and neither does one
// that failed in any other way only after dialFailureSignalHorizon. A timed
// out dial fails at the dialer's ConnectTimeout, 15s after the SYN; a dial
// through a host-supplied dialer without a deadline can fail as late. By then
// the source has retransmitted at 1s and 3s, the multi client's silence
// inference has re-raced a flow that is still waiting, and an app racing
// address families has connected over the other family 250ms in and
// abandoned this attempt. A signal that late speeds nothing up. It only
// strikes the exit for a flow no one waits on, and three such strikes for a
// blackholed AAAA downgrade a healthy dual-stack exit to v4-only (IPV6.md C7).
//
// Every other failure is immediate and answered. tcp + ECONNREFUSED means the
// destination refused: RST+ACK. Anything else on tcp (no route, unreachable,
// EMFILE/ENFILE, EADDRNOTAVAIL, unrecognized) is capacity-class and gets an
// unreachable; defaulting unrecognized errors to the capacity class is
// deliberate -- new clients intercept the signal and old ones drop it at
// ParseIpPath, so a misclassification is cheap. Go does not fold the Windows
// winsock codes onto syscall.ECONNREFUSED/ETIMEDOUT, so isDialRefused and
// isDialKernelTimeout add the native codes (ip_dial_errno_windows.go). udp "dial"
// cannot produce a meaningful ECONNREFUSED at connect time, so udp is always
// capacity-class.
